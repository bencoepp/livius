# Historical War and Conflict Data Visualization Tool

This project exists for two very distinct reasons. The first one is about the actual technical challenges that come from
this project and the different technologies that are used in it. Furthermore, as this is a project mainly for
demonstrative proposals, I also have the challenge of creating, maintaining, and developing a project that can be
understood and worked on by a lot of different people in their respective areas.

The next reason has to do with why I was motivated to work on this project. I really like reading, and learning about
history. But there is not really anything online like a timeline tool that can handle a lot of non-conjunctive data that
I would like to put into correlation with one another. This project is about giving people around the world the option
to work toward discovering, researching, and understanding history using a tool that has the capabilities to make all of
this possible.

## Usage

A comprehensive guide on how to use the tool and its functionalities.

## Development

Details on how to contribute to the project in terms of development, including any coding standards, branching strategy (GitFlow), etc.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project there are three possible ways to do so.

- Software Contribution
- Data Contribution 
- Financial Support

First of software contribution. If you see any problem, issue or bug, or you have an idea that you think might be
of interest to the project than feel free to directly contribute to the project. Anyone can do so if they which to. Just
fork the project, and make a few changes. After a time, and a few contributions we would also like to have you fully on 
board as a moderator for the project. 

Data contribution is for those who wish to contribute there data to the project and or distribute livius in there infrastructure.
Livius lives and dies with the data we feed it, and how good that data is. All uses of the software are able to contribute 
there opinion and feedback to data that is provided through the livius distribution. But as the core of the data in livius
is from research projects we would love for any researchers out there who might have data that could be used in this 
project to come forth and contribute it. The easiest way for that is to deploy livius with the replication service on
your own infrastructure and then feed it your data. Please follow the documentation for this.

The last support you can give this project and the support most needed sometimes is financial support. This project might
not cost much to host, and I will always contribute my own time and money to it. There are times when it can be easier 
for project if there is financial backing behind it to make some things go somewhere. As we do not make any money of any 
data in our system and we do not support any advertisement through the application we solly rely on your support to keep
the ship afloat. 

## Contact
