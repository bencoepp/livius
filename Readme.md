# Historical War and Conflict Data Visualization Tool

This project exists for two very distinct reasons. The first one is about the actual technical challenges that come from
this project and the different technologies that are used in it. Furthermore, as this is a project mainly for
demonstrative proposals, I also have the challenge of creating, maintaining, and developing a project that can be
understood and worked on by a lot of different people in their respective areas.

The next reason has to do with why I was motivated to work on this project. I really like reading, and learning about
history. But there is not really anything online like a timeline tool that can handle a lot of non-conjunctive data that
I would like to put into correlation with one another. This project is about giving people around the world the option
to work toward discovering, researching, and understanding history using a tool that has the capabilities to make all of
this possible.

## Project Overview

We already discussed the problem and issue that this tool is trying to solve. But what how is the project organized and
where can you find what. The basic project structure can be boiled down to this. 

```
/backend
    /libs
    /services
/docs
/frontend
```

The backend part of this project consists out of two parts. The projects java libraries (libs) and the services of the 
backend. Information about a particular service, or library can be found under the documentation of the project. 

Documentation can be as you have probably already guessed can be found under the /docs directory. This is a MkDocs 
project that contains the entire documentation for the project, except for the api references. These can be found in there
respected service directories. But they are referenced in the documentation. The entire documentation site can be found
[here](https://livius.io/docs).

The frontend project is a flutter application that represents the UI, as well as frontend tools to make it possible for
the data to be visualized. The public version of this application can be found [here](https://livius.io).

By popular discussion a cli tool might also become a part of this project depending on the importance as well as the 
necessity for one.

## Getting Started

Instructions on setting up the project, including pre-requisites, software requirements, and initial setup.

## Usage

As already discussed in the project overview this project can not be used as a commercial software. All data will be 
distributed under the same license as it was published and in no way, shape or form will there be made profit with the data
in our system. The rules for using any of the data should be gained through the license of that respected data set. If 
there are any questions about using the data represented in our system please contact us, or the license holder to resolve
them. 

We would love for you to cite us together with the respected data set when publishing any findings or when referring to 
any issued data.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project there are three possible ways to do so.

- Software Contribution
- Data Contribution 
- Financial Support

First of software contribution. If you see any problem, issue or bug, or you have an idea that you think might be
of interest to the project than feel free to directly contribute to the project. Anyone can do so if they which to. Just
fork the project, and make a few changes. After a time, and a few contributions we would also like to have you fully on 
board as a moderator for the project. 

Data contribution is for those who wish to contribute there data to the project and or distribute livius in there infrastructure.
Livius lives and dies with the data we feed it, and how good that data is. All uses of the software are able to contribute 
there opinion and feedback to data that is provided through the livius distribution. But as the core of the data in livius
is from research projects we would love for any researchers out there who might have data that could be used in this 
project to come forth and contribute it. The easiest way for that is to deploy livius with the replication service on
your own infrastructure and then feed it your data. Please follow the documentation for this.

The last support you can give this project and the support most needed sometimes is financial support. This project might
not cost much to host, and I will always contribute my own time and money to it. There are times when it can be easier 
for project if there is financial backing behind it to make some things go somewhere. As we do not make any money of any 
data in our system and we do not support any advertisement through the application we solly rely on your support to keep
the ship afloat.
