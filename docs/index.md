# Welcome to Livius

As you have found your way to this site we assume you are interested in the livius project and want to know more about it.
This site, as well as most content informs you of what the project stands for, what it offers and how you can start using
and contributing in it.

Please note that this is an ever changing project and continuously unter active development. We try to make sure that
every major version that is released and that goes public is tested through and works. But some problems might still arise.

## What this project is about

This project can be broken down into two parts. The first one is about the data, as well as services we provide with it.
Livius is a microservice based application that displays, visualizes and analyses conflict and war data throughout
recorded time. We take in data from a variety of different projects, or open source datasets and combine them with a toolkit
to ease the usage, understanding and analysing the provided data. 

While this is the main point of this application it also serves a secondary purpose. That being a application showcasing
a verity of different tools, concepts and technologies widely used in the industrie with the propose of being a template
as well as guide for other tools, services and applications to be build. 

The application will grow rapidly throughout the coming years, and therefore be ever changing in its nature. But at its
core it is a application meant for scientists, curios people and software engineers looking for an interesting proof of 
concept.
